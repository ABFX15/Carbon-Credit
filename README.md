 Carbon Credit Marketplace

    What: Build a marketplace for tokenized carbon credits, allowing companies and individuals to buy, sell, and trade carbon offsets on-chain.

    Why: Climate change is a pressing global issue, and blockchain can bring transparency and efficiency to carbon markets.

    Features:

        Tokenize carbon credits using ERC-1155 (for semi-fungible tokens).

        Use oracles to verify carbon offset data (e.g., from verified registries like Verra).

        Allow users to retire carbon credits (burn tokens) to offset their emissions.

        Integrate with DeFi protocols to allow carbon credits to be used as collateral.

    Tech Stack:

        Solidity for smart contracts.

        Chainlink oracles for carbon offset data.

        IPFS for storing certificates and metadata.
